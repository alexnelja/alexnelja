## Hi, I’m @alexnelja
- 👀 I’m interested in photography, art and engineering, and where engineering and art meet through code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS and Javascript using the Web Developement Bootcamp on Udemy, and doing the Harvard CS50 course on edX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project in Javascript, HTML, CSS or Python to improve my skills and build my portfolio
